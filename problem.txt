Experiment with depth(number of layers)

Model 1:
Build a model with one hidden layer, and train it
Find the vaalidation accuracy.
(128)

Model 2:
Build a model with 3 hidden layers and train it
Find the vaalidation accuracy.   
(1024,512,256)

Model 3:
Build a model with 5 hidden layers and 
Find the vaalidation accuracy
(1024,512,256,128,64)

plot the vaalidation accuracy for all 3 models in a single plot

plot the vaalidation loss for all 3 models

***********************************************************************************************************************************
Experiment with optimizers(number of layers)

Model 1:
Build a model with SGD optimizers, and train it
Find the validation accuracy.
(SGD)

Model 2:
Build a model with Adam optimizers and train it
Find the vaalidation accuracy.   
(Adam)

Model 3:
Build a model with RMSprop optimizers and 
Find the validation accuracy
(RMSprop)

plot the validation accuracy for all 3 models in a single plot

plot the validation loss for all 3 models

NOTE: different model names for each of the model
